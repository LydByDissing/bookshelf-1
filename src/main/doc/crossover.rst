Speaker crossover
#################

The crossover have been simulated and modelled in XSim. The crossover file linked below contains the filter simulation.
The measurements used doesn't include impendance measurements.

We are going for a crossover frequence of around 2500Hz. This to keep a reasonable wide dispersion.

As seen in the driver measurements the bass driver has various issues above the crossover frequency wich require us to ensure that these are lowered enough, to not make an audible impact in the tweeter section.
